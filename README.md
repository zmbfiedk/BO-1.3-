# mechanics plus explanation

So in this MD ill say all of the mechanics and where i got the inspirations

movement: I made it by simply using a youtube tutorial wich i found a while ago as i was making the first game project of this school year

shooting: My friend has made games like theese bfr and he explained me how to make all of the shooting mechanics.

The enemies: that was a pretty basic system i used google for some things but the code was written by me

enemy check: that i used CHATGPT so id know wich unity tools to use.

Boss: simply reused the enemy code and added an extra function
